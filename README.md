## About me
<p><b>My name is Liliia. And I'd like to join the Gamex team as a Junior QA Engineer.</b></p>
<p>I decided to change my career from Accountant to QA Engineer. I'm wondering how fast tech industry is developing. And how huge step forward are doing those industries where IT joins. That's why I want to be a part of this creative community.</p>

## Some testing for the "Gamex" web-site 
<p> I created small API-testing for the "Gamex" web site using <b>Postman</b> 👉

 <p> One bug is hiding on the "Gamex" website. A screenshot of a bud-report in <b>Jira</b> is here 👉
